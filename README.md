# Retro Mega Next
[Pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org) theme for handheld devices.

Adapted from [David Fumberger's RetroMega](https://github.com/djfumberger/retromega) theme. Completely rewritten from scratch to simplify code and allow me to add new features easier. I looked at each line of code, asking myself "what does it do?", "is it needed?", and "can it be done better?"

## Installation and Scraping
[Download](https://github.com/plaidman/retromega-next/releases) and extract to your [theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes) under the folder retromega. You can then select the theme in the settings menu of Pegasus.

The theme uses `boxart2dfront` on the games list, `screenshot` in the game detail view, and `video` in both areas.

To setup Pegasus with scraped assets, there's a great written guide [available here](https://basvroegop.nl/pegasus) or a great video guide [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWve7YYwGQ). You can also use [DragoonDorise's pegasus installer](https://www.pegasus-installer.com/) to scrape files on your device easier.
